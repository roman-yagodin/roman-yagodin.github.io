Many of us know very well how embarassing could be email routine at work --
it distracts you from the real work, makes you nervous and wasting tons of energy... on hating mail senders.
I hope this short essay will ease your pain, even a little.

<span class="badge">1</span> Mark incoming mail with the "blue star" (Gmail) to separate from rest of the noise -- this is your *Real Mail Inbox*.
Also this way you could see which mails are "new" (unreviewed) even if they are readed.

> Blue stars won't bug you -- they are not yellow - so won't meld with rest of mail, and not red - so not very urgent, and not green - so not very relaxing...

<span class="badge">2</span> Now you need to do your work. I mean -- do you already have something in your GTD? Even if you don't do GTD...
This could autoresolve a number of potential issues with mail. Cause all people do errors and I hope that most of your "blue star" mail senders are people. 

> But do they really people?.. Still you must give the Universe some time to clean things up...

<span class="badge">3</span> Tired doing work? Return to the mail. Read it, do quick replies, create tracker issues with backlinks to mail or [Simpletask](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android) inbox entries -- preferably "in bulk" to avoid thinking about a single thing too much. And only after that remove the "blue stars".

<span class="badge">4</span> And now you need to do your work again -- which all is in your GTD (or anywhere else), but you can forget about mail for now.

> Just one thing at the time... 

<span class="badge">5</span> Tired of work again? A quick trip to the mail!

> Scatter some blue stars!..
