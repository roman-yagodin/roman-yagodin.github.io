# About roman-yagodin.github.io

R7 personal blog is the place for the articles about everything that I found interesting 
and also the place for my humble experiments with Jekyll, GitHib Pages, Markdown and Bootstrap. 

## Why R7?

I use "R7" as a namespace prefix in most of my code projects. And it's just my name abbreviation, 
you see - just count the letters after first name:

```C#
var myname = "Roman Yagodin";
var r7 = myname [0].ToString () + myname.Split (' ') [1].Length;
```
